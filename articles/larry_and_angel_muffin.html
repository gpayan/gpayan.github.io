                <h3>A day at the park with his beloved Angel Muffin</h3>
                <p>Today was such a fun day for Larry and Angel Muffin. They got to spend some quality time 
                    at the park. Angel Muffin was a good boi,
                    despite the fact that he kept wanting to smell people's feet.
                    Way to go Angel Muffin!
                </p>
